Visit LA and explore the historic Venice Canals and Venice Boardwalk with an LA native and local photographer Elle Gamboa. My 4-hour walking photo tour will cover the Venice Canal created by conservationist & developer Abbot Kinney. After the Canal walk, we will take a short Uber ride to Venice Board Walk and explore this alternative and very creative community of shop owners, restaurants, artists, and skate boarders. We will also check out Muscle Beach and Venice Skate Park.
